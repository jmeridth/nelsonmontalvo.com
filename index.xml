Update: Please make sure to read the comments. You will have a full picture of how many lives that Nelson blessed.
Today I was told that a close friend of mine and LosTechies alumni, Nelson Montalvo, was killed in a tragic car accident. I&amp;rsquo;m still in shock. He was an amazing man. His generosity, humility, charm, knowledge, love for the software industry, learning ability, and teaching skills are all things I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss dearly.</description></item><item><title>Obituary</title><link>https://nelsonmontalvo.com/obituary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nelsonmontalvo.com/obituary/</guid><description>Nelson Montalvo Jr.
